## (。・ω・)？

This is lactobionicAcid, and you could call me *lA.* for short.
<br/>I am a rhythm games player living in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Coding is just a side job. No any hobbies at this moment.

I communicate mainly in Chinese and English.

Most of the time is probably spent playing rhythm games. Late at night I occasionally move around the [Hex-Dragon/PCL2](https://github.com/Hex-Dragon/PCL2) repository. Now I am learning to program in C# and Visual Basic.

## About My Name...

Initially, I was hoping to use C12H22O11 as the screen name, but since that name is already in use by many people, so I modified it slightly to C12H22O**12**.
<br/>After searching on the Internet, I got the organic substance Lactobionic Acid, which is the counterpart of C12H22O12, and the current screen name lactobionicAcid was created.

So far, it seems that this name is unique, meaning that I'm the only person on the net using lactobionicAcid as a screen name.
<br/>Likewise, if you see the name (or other similar variants) on other platforms, it's more than likely me.

## About Rhythm Games...

Currently I am mainly playing Phigros, Rotaeno, Milthm, Project SEKAI (chs), Vivid/stasis, *etc.*
<br/>Phigros is kind of the earliest rhythm game I ever got into. My RKS is 16.44, Challenge mode rating is Rainbow 45.

I hope to get into more rhythm games in the future, but only if I get a new iPad, as the old one had only 64 GB of storage. That is definitely not enough.
